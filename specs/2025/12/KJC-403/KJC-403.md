CI/CD to create binary and publish to npm-registry since it's open source and any body can use

update readme file, guide user how to start using and test this cli.

Basically, here is the flow

## Prerequiste
- update your workflow `/ command` of ur favourite ide (currently developed for Antigravity)  (just copy from `workflows` directory into ur global or workspace workflows command
- require `gh` (github cli client)

## Workflow
- create new branch, e.g. `git checkout -b <ticker_number>`
- run `kj spec <ticket_number>` on ur CLI
- Draft your user prompt in here instead od chat to keep the history, link into the MR for future audit and investigation
- To let AI implement, in chat, run workflow with ticket_number, e.g. `/kj-spec-implement <ticket_number>`, it will read the story spec and start implement like usual, and create artifacts for audit under this directory
- Any changes in spec, u can update the spec file directly and run `kj spec update <ticket_number>` to let the working directory match the udpated spec.
- run `kj pr create` to create a MR once u finish development, this will generate and attached all necessary info e.g. your original user promot, ai implementation plan and put it nicely in PR description for later audit, historical record, feed AI to improve next time
- merge MR and follow usual relase process
