# KJC-401:

Remove OpenAI Dependencies from this project

We no longer need to use LLM since we've got metadata in artifacts folder

So, these are the changes we need when user to `kj pr create`:


1. Read artifacts folder of current ticket number
2. find `metadata.json`, prase that information, contract is {pr_title: string, pr_summary: string}

- use `pr_title` for PR title when create
- in PR Description, put in this format

# AI Summary
{pr_summary}

# User Prompt
{user_prompt from the original spec file}

# Artifacts
- {upload implemeentation_plan.md}
- {upload walkthrough.md}
